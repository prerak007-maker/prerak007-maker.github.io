The larger motor also complies with BS6 emission norms. In terms of underpinnings, the 2020 Low Rider S retains the same Softail chassis that was introduced with the 2018 lineup. It's lighter, stiffer and more dynamically capable. The same goes for the preload-adjustable monoshock. What's changed though is the front suspension setup which is the same chunky upside fork borrowed from the Fat Bob. Further amplifying its handling is the change in the bike's rake angle -- from 30-degrees to 28-degrees. Consequently, the wheelbase now stands at 1615mm, shorter by 15mm. Braking has also been improved thanks to the new twin-disc setup upfront. </p>
