                    <p>the CBR1000R Fireblade. The aggressive styling is also befitting of the ‘R’ suffix that Honda has chosen for the bike. Moreover, the lowered clip-ons and rear-set footpegs lend the bike an aggressive riding posture which complements its bold styling. The CBR650R draws power from a 649cc liquid-cooled, inline-four mill that produces 88PS at 11,500rpm and 60.1Nm of peak torque at 8000rpm. The international model, on the other hand, makes 95PS at 12,000rpm while producing 64Nm of torque at 8500rpm. Power difference aside, the two models are identical. </p>
