                      <p>the Kawasaki Ninja 300 is all set to be updated with a BS6 motor. However, the brand will only launch it some time after the norms come into effect. Expect the BS6 Ninja 300 to be launched in mid-2020 with a price tag of around Rs 3.2 lakh. For reference, the current Ninja 300 is priced at Rs 2.98 lakh (ex-showroom India). Apart from emission compliance, the bike is expected to remain unchanged in terms of underpinnings. However, expect the output figures to drop slightly in favour of cleaner emissions. To give you a better perspective, the bike at present makes 39PS and 27Nm.</p>

                     <p> the Ninja ZX-10R has won three World Superbike Championships in a row. Thanks to its racing credentials, the motorcycle is one of the most highly sought-after machines in its segment. The design is unmistakably Ninja, with black and green Kawasaki Racing Team livery. The motorcycle has a 998cc in-line four heart that pumps out 200PS of power  at 13,000rpm. With RAM air assist, the power further goes up by 10PS at the same rpm. The peak torque of 113.5Nm arrives at 11,500rpm. The engine works in conjunction with Bosch’s 6-axis Inertial Measurement Unit that communicates with a range of assorted rider aids.</p>

The HG variant will be a touring spec version with a flyscreen and crash bobbins as add-ons. While the 2017 model is now BS-IV compliant, updates include just a gear position indicator. The Z 1000 features no riding aids baring ABS. It seems like Kawasaki intends to keep the Z 1000 as more of a pure motorcycle, devoid of electronics.</p>
